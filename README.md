# SupportCo

This is an (example) application for a tech support organization. The app allows a user to submit a ticket, as well as for an employee to view and update tickets. This application was built in ASP.NET.

On the homepage, there is the option to choose to create or view/update tickets. To create a ticket, the user submits a form containing their name, their email address, the type of device they are having problems with, and a description of the problem. The form connects to a database using ASP and SQLite. The same database is called upon to view and/or update tickets.
